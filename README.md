# CiOpenGl-Tutorial
Gettings started with Cinder glNext(0.9.0?)'s new OpenGL API.

_DISCLAIMER: As of today (2015.02.18), this project should be considered experimental as Cinder's API is subject to change!_

This repo is a port of various modern OpenGL tutorials to Cinder, both for learning purposes and as stubs for other work.<br/>
