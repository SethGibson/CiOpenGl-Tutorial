# CiOpenGl-Tutorial
**UPDATE (2015.03.10):** Added LightingBasic1

Gettings started with Cinder glNext(0.9.0?)'s new OpenGL API.

_DISCLAIMER: This project should be considered experimental until expressly stated otherwise, as Cinder's API is subject to change!_

This repo is a port of various modern OpenGL tutorials to Cinder, both for learning purposes and as stubs for other work.<br/>
